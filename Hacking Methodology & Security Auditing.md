## Types Of Testing By WHH
Based on level of assistance by the organisation there is 3 types of testing:-
1. White Box Testing:- The security expert gets complete assistance from the organisation. The security analyst gets complete access to the clients website.
2. Black Box Testing:- The security expert gets no assistance from the organisation and he is on his own.
3. Grey Box Tesing: The security expert gets partial assistance from the organisation such as the server details and some demo accounts but he wont get the crutial information.
