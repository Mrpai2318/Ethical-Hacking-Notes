## Looking for common ports
HTTP: HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and it is used to transfer hyper text, which means web pages.

HTTPS: This is the secure version of HTTP, where s stands for secured and is used to transfer web pages in a secured way. Most websites that we visit, like internshala, amazon, google, etc., use HTTPS and not HTTP.
The fact that it is secured means that all communications between your browser and the website you are connected to, will be encrypted.
You can see this in the address bar located at the top of the browser.

FTP: FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol and is used while transferring files.

SMTP: SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and as the name suggests, it is used to send emails from one device to another. But when you open gmail, or compose and send an email, does your address bar show SMTP, or HTTPS. Well, try it and find out for yourself, and lookout for the reason somewhere in this topic.

Telnet: This protocol is used to remotely run system commands on the server.

SSH: SSH is Secure Shell and is like a secure or encrypted version of Telnet.

VOIP: This stands for Voice Over Internet Protocol and is used for making a voice call over the internet.
